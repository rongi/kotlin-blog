With Kotlin extension functions it's possible to display toasts as simple as this:

```kotlin
"This is my string".toast(context)
```

You'll just need to define this extension function somewhere in your code:

```kotlin
fun Any.toast(context: Context, duration: Int = Toast.LENGTH_SHORT): Toast {
  return Toast.makeText(context, this.toString(), duration).apply { show() }
}
```

This solution especially shines when combined this with Kotlin's string templates feature:

```kotlin
"click on ${position.name}".toast(context)
```
Look at the beauty of that!

For comparison, this is how you write the same code with Java:

```java
String message = String.format("click on %d", position.name);
Toast.makeText(context, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show()
```
